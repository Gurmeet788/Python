#this whole program is about probplitie mean the computer chiose random number but we give tham the the problity of choise mean above program we say number have 10% chase to come and 2 have 30% ok we set chase.

#Replace mean the dublicate is allow or not 
#Size mean how many number you want 
# p = probity

#Note: The sum of problity set is 1 not more or less than 1.
